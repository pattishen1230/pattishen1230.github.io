I am a master student in Financial Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My current research focuses on **FinTech, Empirical Asset Pricing, Derivatives Markets, Machine Learning (Neural Networks, Interpretability Analysis)**. Before this, I had five years of work experience, with four years serving as an operations manager at the Agricultural Bank of China and one year as an economics teacher at an international school. My CV is available from [here](https://pattishen1230.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
