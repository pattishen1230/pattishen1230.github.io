<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12500.pdf">American Option Pricing using Self-Attention GRU and Shapley Value Interpretation</a>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Construct four different machine learning models, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), self-attention LSTM, and self-attention gated recurrent unit (GRU) in comparison to the traditional binomial model.</li>
    <li>The results show that the self-attention GRU model with historical data outperforms other models due to its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies embedded in the historical data.</li>
    <li>Employ the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret and analyze the prediction results of the self-attention GRU model with historical data, which provides insights that the current spot price, strike, and moneyness have the greatest impacts on predicting the current SPY call price.</li>
  </ul>
